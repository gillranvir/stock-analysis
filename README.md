## Summary

### General advantages and disadvantages of refactoring
#### Advantages
* Refactoring can help in making the script more efficient to run
* Refactoring can also make the script more pliable to additional changes or using it as a template for other problems
* The script can be made more concise with the help of refactoring

#### Disadvantages
* Refactoring can introduce a higher level of complexity in the intial phase of writing the script and hence some additional efforts are required to make it work
Code Refactoring was un-successful and will be attempted again.


### Advantages / Disadvantages of original and refactored VBA script
#### Advantages of refactoring in the stocks analysis challenge
* It can be clearly seen that the time required to run the code reduced by more than 75% when compared with the initial attempt. This is a significant difference and shows the efficiency gains enabled by refactoring

#### Disadvantages of refactoring:
* The refactoring introduced some complexity because of which it took longer for me to remove the bugs and make the code work.
